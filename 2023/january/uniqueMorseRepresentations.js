/*
Unique Morse Code Words

Given an array of strings words where each word can be written as a concatenation of the Morse code of each letter.

For example, "cab" can be written as "-.-..--...", which is the concatenation of "-.-.", ".-", and "-...". We will call such a concatenation the transformation of a word.
Return the number of different transformations among all words we have.

Example 1:

Input: words = ["gin","zen","gig","msg"]
Output: 2
Explanation: The transformation of each word is:
"gin" -> "--...-."
"zen" -> "--...-."
"gig" -> "--...--."
"msg" -> "--...--."
There are 2 different transformations: "--...-." and "--...--.".
